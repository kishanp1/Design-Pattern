## To clean:
ant -buildfile src/build.xml clean

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## To compile: 
ant -buildfile src/build.xml all

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## To run by specifying arguments from command line 
## We will use this to run your code
ant -buildfile src/build.xml run -Darg0=/import/linux/home1/kpatel51/cs542/kishankumar_patel_assign_2/studentCoursesBackup/input.txt -Darg1=/import/linux/home1/kpatel51/cs542/kishankumar_patel_assign_2/studentCoursesBackup/delete.txt -Darg2=/import/linux/home1/kpatel51/cs542/kishankumar_patel_assign_2/studentCoursesBackup/output1.txt -Darg3=/import/linux/home1/kpatel51/cs542/kishankumar_patel_assign_2/studentCoursesBackup/output2.txt -Darg4=/import/linux/home1/kpatel51/cs542/kishankumar_patel_assign_2/studentCoursesBackup/output3.txt

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## To create tarball for submission
ant -buildfile src/build.xml tarzip or tar -zcvf firstName_secondName_assign_number.tar.gz firstName_secondName_assign_number

"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied
it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if
I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an
official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in
my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a
grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I
will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional
offense.‚Äù

Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
term of Big O complexity (time and/or space)

I have used BST for this project, as other than easy understanding of
BST, with large number of node N, it gives consistent logN time 
complexity for search and insert.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Provide list of citations (urls, etc.) from where you have taken code
(if any).

For learning and clarifying BST concept I have refered this youtube
